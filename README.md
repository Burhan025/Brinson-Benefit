# Brinson-Benefit
In this project, I have registered custom navigation menus, sidebars, and widgets, created custom post types, and adjusted excerpt lengths. Implemented a dynamic WordPress template to display posts based on categories, dates, and custom fields, integrating summaries, read-more links, and pagination.
